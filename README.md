Searches through your email inbox, looking for job alerts that you've subscribed to (from [Google Jobs](https://jobs.google.com/about/) or [IFTTT twitter](https://ifttt.com/twitter) applets) and attempts to consolidate the data into a database. A WUI allows the user to then track the leads they will follow up on.

## Dependencies [&#x219F;](#contents)

These tools must first be installed on the system:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))

Build the application-specific docker images:

```sh
# docker build ...
make docker-image
```

## Usage [&#x219F;](#contents)

Start the entire Docker-Compose system stack:

```sh
# docker-compose up ...
make docker-run
```

Then visit the web interface: [:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Development [&#x219F;](#contents)

Some helpers for developing locally:

```sh
# Start up services in debug mode
export DEBUG=true
make docker-run

# To run unit-tests inside docker
make docker-test

# Or, to run unit tests locally, install dependencies
./scripts/setup.sh

# And run the test frameworks
./scripts/test.sh
```
